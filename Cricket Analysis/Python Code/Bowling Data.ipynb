Not much he could do about that.. 203/643.4 to Mohammed Shami, huge mow and edges behind! Another one down. Not sure that was a sensible choice from Shami.

Short and into the pitch once again, angling in and aiming for the top of the stumps. Kohli does not have room to free his arms and the ball isn't coming onto the bat either on this pitch.

He wasn't leaving it to anyone else. 174/639.5 to JP Inglis, bowled 'im, Inglis plays over a straight one! Coetzee finds the perfect full length, cross-seam and skidding under the bat as he tries to flick off his toes. Gets the benefit of forcing the batter back with short stuff, as half a stride forward would have turned that into a full toss. Instead it sneaks through to light up the zing bails and rekindle SA hopes!. 193/7See all photos\"],\n",

This ball hangs up for a while, dips on Rohit who takes him on, but ends up skewing it high in the air towards mid-off. Williamson runs back, and then positions himself superbly under the skier and takes the swirler.. 71/143.6 to V Kohli, Struck flat and hard, but Conway makes no mistake this time. Kohli walks off to a round of applause. Kohli steps out to another full ball and shovels it away to Conway at deep square leg. Good, low catch in the outfield. The incoming Rahul gives Kohli a pat. 327/249.1 to SA Yadav, Phillips just about clings onto this skier. He tears in from deep midwicket, goes for the catch with both hands, but manages to catch it by keeping one of his wrists around the ball. Almost popped out. Slower ball from Southee, hides it away from Iyer's swinging arc, and has him holing out. 382/4 Previous NextSee all photos\"],\n",

It's a hittable delivery, Williamson looks to pick him into the short square boundary but may have hit it off the bottom and it finds Surya's lap at the ropes. Shami dropped him a while earlier but has breathed some life into India with this massive, massicve strike.. 220/332.4 to TWM Latham, struck on the pad and given! It's a double-strike for Shami. Latham plays all around one that comes back in with the angle. It's so plumb that he doesn't even bother reviewing. It skids back in to hit him on the pad, would've crashed into middle and leg.. 220/445.2 to DJ Mitchell, Jadeja pockets another catch in the deep. Five-wicket haul for Shami. Pitched up on the pads, Mitchell picks it up and whips it to Jadeja at deep midwicket. End of a terrific innings from Mitchell. He raises his bat. Kane and Co are up on their feet in the dressing room, appluding Mitchell. Shami, meanwhile, holds the ball up and celebrates. 306/748.2 to TG Southee, Make that six wickets for Shami. Full and outside off, Southee has a big drive and nicks it behind. Rahul dives across to his right to pouch a smart, low catch. Shami is the second Indian bowler, after Nehra, to collect six wickets in World Cups. 321/948.5 to LH Ferguson, Shami finishes it off for India with a seven-for! What a bowler! He comes away with India's best-ever bowling figures in ODI cricket. Rahul bags another catch behind the stumps. Back of a length and outside off, kisses the outside edge. India KO NZ and storm into the final. 327/10 Previous NextSee all photos\"],\n",

Was the leg break on off and middle. He bends low for a sweep, misses it caught bang in front of the stumps. Replays suggest the ball would have crashed into off pole. Success almost right away for Kuldeep.. 66/242.1 to LV van Beek, That's that! Leg break on the stumps and was bowled fuller. Van Beek goes for an almighty slog, plays all over it and sees his leg stump pegged back. Kuldeep has his second and India will want to wrap this up quickly.. 208/7See all photos\"],\n",

Shaping back in, beating the pad, hitting the pad. Shafique is advised not to review, and England get off to the perfect start. 0/12.4 to Fakhar Zaman, he's going all right! Straight to the pavilion!  Couldn't find his touch today, and he forces the issue, running down the wicket only to smear it straight to mid-off. Willey gives him a little salute as he now touches 99 ODI wickets. 10/236.4 to Agha Salman, scooped up to Ben Stokes at mid-on, and David Willey has 100 ODI wickets!.

The ball flies off the outer half of the bat towards Miller at backward point. Seems a fairly regulation chance but Miller fumbles at the first attempt. The ball then pops out and he performs a sweet, little juggling act before eventually holding onto the chance, inches off the turf. Afghanistan lose their fourth!. 94/427.4 to Mohammad Nabi, is there a nick?! South Africa think so but the umpire does not! Back of a length outside off. Seems to zip through off the surface and Nabi, without any foot movement, wafts at it. de Kock and Ngidi feel that Nabi has feathered this through to the keeper. The umpire is unmoved, and South Africa, unsurprisingly, go upstairs. And they are vindicated. There is a clear spike when the ball is next to the outside edge of the bat, and Afghanistan slider further!. 116/6See all photos'],\n",

Short ball going down leg and Zadran's pull has been edged to the keeper moving to his right. 41/226.5 to Ikram Alikhil, gets him with a fuller length now! Not quite full per se but much fuller than the previous ball. Alikhil, after seeing the ball whistle past him the previous delivery, is caught on the crease and pokes at it without any footwork. Feathers it through to de Kock, who pouches a smart, low catch. Coetzee has his second, and Afghanistan are in a lot of trouble now!. 112/545.6 to Noor Ahmad, Quinton de Kock - third keeper to take six catches in a men's ODI World Cup match, after Adam Gilchrist and Sarfaraz Ahmed. Noor attempts the pull against a searing short ball, and gets a glove to the wicketkeeper. 204/847.4 to Mujeeb Ur Rahman, short ball gets big on Mujeeb as he attempts the pull.

Fires it in on a back of a length on middle and off. Stops on the surface and just does not arrive. Miller is too early into the stroke and all he does is pop it straight back to Nabi, who crouches down low and completes the catch. Is there a twist left in this tale?. 182/5See all photos'],\n",

Boult convinces Williamson to review though as he thinks the two noises were two pad noises instead of the bat. This was nipping in off a good length and struck Asalanka on the back pad.

       "  '9.3 to MDKJ Perera, And now Perera departs!  This was not quite there to drive, Perera goes hard at this and only manages to get under it. It goes straight up in the air and Santner circles under it around cover and takes well judged catch as the ball fell over his shoulder. Sri Lanka in all sorts of trouble now.. 70/523.3 to C Karunaratne, Edged and gone? Joel Wilson raises the finger. The change in angle works for Ferguson and New Zealand. Bowls it full and fast just outside off, cross-seam as well. Karunaratne goes for the drive away from the body but is never really in a good position - partly because his weight is on the back foot expecting a short ball. He only manages a thick outside edge, no error from Latham. 113/8See all photos'],\n",

       "  \"16.4 to AD Mathews, Lovely delivery and a just reward for Santner. Hangs it out there on a length. Bowls it with a slightly side-arm action. Deceives Mathews in flight. The flight draws him forward but the ball dips and lands on a length around off. Mathews lunges to defend but a thick outside edge lobs towards slip, where Mitchell does no mistake. Sri Lanka continue to slide. 104/618.3 to DM de Silva, Another one for Santner. Another lovely low catch from Mitchell. Fires it in on a length outside off at 81.6kph. Because the lines of the previous deliveries were in line of the stumps, Dhananjaya was enticed into playing at that. But this was outside off. And Santner's height gave him the extra lift. Dhananjaya fends at that because of the bounce and gets a thick outside edge to slip, who dives to his right and pouches that. 105/7See all photos\"],\n",

This was tossed up outside off, and Chameera just slices this straight to backward point. 128/946.4 to D Madushanka, And that is that. Latham holds on to a sharp catch and Sri Lanka have been bowled out for 171. Lands it on a length around middle and leg, Madushanka goes back to defend but gets a feather behind.

Looped up from round the wicket, he leans into a lofted drive, gets neither power nor placement through the stroke. A powder-puff launch, floats to long-off as if on a parachute, which is much as this innings now is.. 192/6 Previous NextSee all photos\"],\n",

Root telegraphed the shot, stood laterally with feet relatively wide apart and tried to go over third. Ball didn't bounce as much as he expected. Root tried to jam his feet together but it was too late, the ball flicked the inside of his thigh pad and scooted through.. 133/249.4 to BA Stokes, smashed to long-off! Stokes swings hard once more, but can't connect cleanly through the slower ball. One hand comes off the bat, as the ball skews off a closed face, high to Engelbrecht, inside the rope. A mighty innings comes to an end. 334/9See all photos\"],\n",

It was on off stump, 133ks, and he tried to power it through, bat turned outwards in his hand and he loses power. Van Meekeran backtracks a step or two and takes it above his shoulders.

Dug deep into the pitch by de Leede, it was on the fifth-stump line and Brook tried to whack it across.

Edwards snaffles the edge to end a fine innings and a crucial stand. 321/748.6 to DJ Willey, full length, belted straight at long-on!

Absolutely demolished him with a heat-seeking yorker and you could just sense a wicket was around the corner because Afghanistan's innings have kind of come to a halt and they are itching to tee off.. 173/3 Previous NextSee all photos\"],\n",

Hazlewood provides Australia with the opening breakthrough. 38/145.3 to Mohammad Nabi, Sounds the death rattle!  Nice seam up delivery on a slightly shorter length, it jags back just enough to go through his defences and disturb the furniture. Nabi wanted to batter it over midwicket but was deceived by the late inward movement and was a touch early into the hoik. Hazlewood successfully manages to flummox him with an incredible delivery right on target; he seldom misses it. The idea was right from Nabi though, it's time to go for some heavy lifting and he had to take risks and go hard. 233/5See all photos\"],\n",

Vociferous appeal in unison for an lbw and the umpire raises the dreaded finger. Stoinis has reviewed this. Looks like there is no bat and gloves involved but ulta-edge is yet to confirm it. Well, it brushes the front pad and has clearly missed the gloves according to the evidence on the ultraedge. Alright, so it's pitching outside off, impact in line and smashing the middle - Australia lose their sixth wicket. Clearly, Stoinis was struggling against Rashid and didn't back himself to get the better of him. Australia staring into the abyss as wickets continue to tumble.

This is mind-boggling reflex action from Ikram who swoops to his left, couldn't hold onto it in the first attempt and the ball popped out of his glove but he didn't give up and went airborne, gobbled it up on the second attempt and Starc cannot believe it!

But this one has extra bounce on it and takes a thick edge, which flies high to Mushfiqur's left. The Bangladesh keeper though goes completely airborne and grabs this with his left mitt, in front of first slip. Moment of magic. 5/145.6 to M Theekshana, taken at deep third! That seemed to have been timed nicely though. That sharp short ball was angling into Theekshana, who was cramped for room as the ball ended on middle and leg. He almost had little option but to have a ramp at that, sending it right into the fielder's reverse-cupped hands. 258/7 Previous NextSee all photos\"],\n",

Tanzim kept teasing him with a consistent line just outside off, bowling this one on a good length around sixth stump. Nissanka went flaying at it with a flat bat, perhaps playing early too. The ball took the bottom edge, and clattered on to the stumps. 72/348.4 to KIC Asalanka, taken at deep point! That flew off Asalanka's bat, and seemed to have come off the higher side too. Short of a length from Tanzim - this time with rapid pace rather than any change of it - as the ball skidded through outside off. Asalanka looked to slap it, only for the ball to land exactly where Litton was placed. 278/848.6 to CAK Rajitha, very well taken by Litton! He was almost getting off balance, while his cap had fallen off too, but he kept his eyes on the ball all along. Placed at deep square leg, he moved to his left to take it reverse cupped. Another short ball from Tanzim - there have been plenty from him today to the tailenders - as this one shaped back in sharply to finish outside leg. Rajitha had a pull at it with his eyes taken off, and though the first impression was that of a six, he fell without scoring in the end. 278/9See all photos\"],\n",

There was hardly any pace to work with for Mendis, and his low run continues. 66/224.2 to S Samarawickrama, And now he finds the man! Skips down the track, but doesn't quite get to pitch.

The ball was short and around sixth stump, as DDS had skipped down the pitch very early. Seeing the length, he seemed to have no option but to have a nudge at it; however, the ball passed between his bat and pad, and straight to Mushi. The latter failed to grab it at first attempt, but DDS being miles down allowed Mushi the time to recollect - both the ball, and himself - as he whipped the leg stump off. The third umpire also wanted to clarify if the stumps were broken without the ball in Mushi's hands. 213/6See all photos\"],\n",

Bowled on the shorter side of a length, and angled in, with the seam canted towards fine leg.

First replay shows that the sound actually came off the bat hitting the ground, so no edge. It hit him on the front pad, well below the knee-roll.

Swung across the line and it went very high, but Zampa had a lot of work to do from fine leg. He raced in and then took off, clutching the ball in two hands before going on a victory lap. Australia two wickets away. 216/848.1 to AU Rashid, short ball, top-edged up the chimney! Inglis settles under the catch and it's goodnight, Ahmedabad! Pace off into the pitch again, Rashid swung for the hills but the ball went nowhere. And with that, England are officially out of contention for the semi-finals, their defence of the ODI World Cup over. 253/10 Previous NextSee all photos\"],\n",

There might have been a little bobble. No, in fact, very clean. 103/336.6 to LS Livingstone, short ball, taken by the flying Abbott at midwicket! Livingstone has been turned over cheaply and England are falling away here. Struck firmly on the pull but it was at a nice height as Abbott turned and threw himself to his right for a two-handed take. Scrambled seam from Cummins. 174/6 Previous NextSee all photos'],\n",

This one keeps going on with the angle and de Leede has a loose waft at it. Gets the faintest of tickles and Alikhil gobbles it up behind the stumps!. 97/530.6 to LV van Beek, stumped by a mile! Beautifully done! Has this on a string and the ball dips very late on van Beek. Looking at the flight, he thinks he can get to the ball. But because the ball drops so late, van Beek is caught in no man's land. Has a hopeful waft at it but the ball scrapes past the outside edge. Alikhil effects the stumping and Nabi, on his first over back, has his second wicket!. 134/746.3 to PA van Meekeren, appeal for lbw and given! van Meekeren reviews because Netherlands have reviews in hand. Is there a bottom edge? Well, worth trying atleast. This was a full ball on off and destined for middle. Paul tried the sweep and missed. UltraEdge will clear all doubts...no edge, he's gone.

Gurbaz, having advanced, tries to help it fine. The umpire feels he has gotten nothing on it, but Edwards and van Beek reckon it has flicked the glove on the way through. The ball is awfully close to the glove, it must be said. And there is a spike when the ball is next to the glove. An excellent review, and Gurbaz has to go!. 27/1See all photos'],\n",

Rohit plays back in the crease, searching for the inswinger. But this one swerves away past the outside edge and sends the off stump cartwheeling. It was the offcutter with the new ball from Madushanka. Bona fide contender for the ball of the tournament. 4/129.6 to Shubman Gill, No hundred for Gill! Another offcutter from Madushanka, this one at 122ks. The one that got Rohit was a quicker one at 136ks. Banged into the pitch and cramps Gill. He looks to ramp it down to deep third but can only guide it behind to Kusal Mendis as Madushanka finds extra bounce to unsettle the batter. 193/231.3 to V Kohli, Another cutter. Kohli plops it to short cover. Madushanka has stunned the Wankhede. Another Mustafizur-esque cutter outside off, this one at 114ks. Kohli is early into a drive and offers a simple catch to Nissanka. Madushanka has taken out India's top three: Rohit, Gill and Kohli. He's having a sensational World Cup. 196/341.3 to SA Yadav, SKY's stay is short lived! Short ball and Sri Lanka are confident here! This was over SKY's right shoulder as he looks to hook it. It passes very close to the glove as Mendis collects. Umpire is unmoved but Mendis reviews immediately. And there is indeed a slight spike on Ultra Edge. The crowd are hushed. 276/547.3 to SS Iyer, Madushanka has the last laugh though! This was another wide one, and another slower one. Iyer gets a toe-end on this as he has to reach for it, and he can only slice it straight up in the air for Theekshana to gobble it up at extra cover. That's five for Madushanka!. 333/6 Previous NextSee all photos\"],\n",
